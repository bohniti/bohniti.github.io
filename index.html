                <p>
                    After three years as a business trainee, I decided to learn more about business and technology while attending a bachelor's program.
                    After I learned the basics, I have been developed a great interest in data science and medicine.
                    Exploring data and adequately visualizing them is a great pleasure to me, and I hope to work on many more exciting projects.</br></br>


                    Furthermore, I am really into cooking and sports, especially bouldering, climbing, and hiking. I also like to see the world from different angles while I do handstands. If you ask my girlfriend, she states that I should do something creative. </br></br>I would say that I apply Bellman Equation in optimizing my life (a Markov decision process), but the future discount factor Î³ in the equation might be small, and I would often be trapped in a local optimum.

                    </br></br> I started climbing around six years ago at a bouldering gym. Since then, I got much stronger, and I have learned a lot. I enjoy being outdoors and high up the most, but a good session at an artificial wall also offers plenty of fun, mainly because it's easy to have a friendly chat with another climber.            </p>
