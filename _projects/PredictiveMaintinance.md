# Motivation

Anomaly detection is a critical step towards building a reliable ct scanner. Several ct scanners' logs are collected to record significant events such that we can debug failures and perform root cause analysis.
We propose a deep neural network model utilizing state of the art techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Deep learning allows us to learn log patterns automatically and predict wheater we have an error or not. Also, we demonstrate how to handle class imbalance. Furthermore, our model will be able to determine the performance of a scanner within a specific day. Extensive experimental evaluations over large log data will ensure that our model will not overfit.
