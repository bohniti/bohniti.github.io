  <h2>Project Scope</h2>
  <p>Advancing prospects of the introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) offers a new way of communicating
  in urban environments. Communication is taking place via external Human Machine Interfaces (eHMIs)
  between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users. The use of eHMIs is not only expected to succeed
  at single-lane intersections but even to replace redundant traffic signal systems. Automation has the
  potential to increase safety for road users and enables more efficient traffic control. Automation is not
  only essential but also the involvement of vulnerable road users to gain acceptance and trust on their side.
  This work investigates eHMIs for communication between AVs and vulnerable road users at intersections
  without traffic lights using the user-centered design process. The focus is traffic participantsâ€™ needs at all
  stages to enable easy and fast road crossing. The methods analysis of the current situation, visioning,
  environment analysis, observation eased to identify an intersection layout. Important aspects of scalability,
  a cognitive walkthrough, and an interview helped to determine an appropriate eHMI design. Through
  an online survey compared the external Human Machine Interface concept to the traffic light concept
  in terms of user experience, emotional state, unambiguity, and acceptance in illustrated video scenes.
  The evaluation showed that the eHMI concept partly has significantly higher ratings for user experience
  and emotional state than the traffic light concept. When comparing the eHMI scenarios, the scenarios
  with the AVs with the same behaviors achieved the highest acceptance, followed by different behaviors
  of the AVs with apparent reason, and lastly, different behaviors of the AVs with unclear reason. This
  demonstrates the importance of equally behaving AVs at traffic light-less intersections to maintain high
  pedestrian acceptance.</p>
