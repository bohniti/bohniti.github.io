<p>The scope of the project is association of historical fragments using deep metric learning. More precisely, Iâ€™m
interested in the fragments from the HisFrac20 Dataset, and the objective is to reconstruct them prior to their analysis
by archeology experts. The task is challenging since image size is large, the images are from a broad domain and
it is also hard for humans to notice the minor differences which distigunish two fragments.</p>

<h1 id="dataset">Dataset</h1>

<p>The dataset contains a set of pages from different writers split into a huge number of fragments such as this:</p>

<p>So the work of an auther can look like as in the following sample:</p>

<p>Siamese neural networks (metric learning, twin networks) are an artifical neural network containing two or more identical subnetworks components that share</p>
